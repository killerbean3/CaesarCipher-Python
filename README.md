# Caesar Cipher with an encryption key
# This is a code I developed when I was 16 and has been recently revamped to be better, easier to read and more optimised than before
#
# There are 3 files, Cipher.py, ekey.txt and words.txt. words.txt is for what you want encrypting, ekey.txt is for your encryption key and Cipher.py is the code.
# The code works by converting the letters in ekey and words into numbers, then adding them together and finally converting them back into letters.
# So the word "python" with the encryption key of "code" would convert "python" to "snxmrc". 
# This code can decrypt it too with the correct encryption key
# This code will remove spaces and disallow numbers or symbols
